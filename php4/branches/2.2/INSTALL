  APACHE SETUP 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use your web server to host only 1 website you need to set your DocumentRoot option 
to point to your project's root directory, i.e.
DocumentRoot YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY

You also have either to copy contents from YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ to 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/shared/ or make an alias to that directory, i.e.
Alias /shared YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/

If you host many website on your web server you can make changes to Virtual Hosts section 
of httpd.conf file. Here's a valid example of the virtual host setup:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.6

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.6>
    DocumentRoot YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    ServerName YOUR_PROJECT
    ErrorLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-error_log
    CustomLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-access_log common
		Alias /shared YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ #shared directory alias
</VirtualHost>

NOTE: You may skip aliasing the shared directory by simply copying 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ contents to YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/shared/ directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SETTING PERMISSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your PHP installation will need write access to the YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/var directory.
Usually this directory contains several subdirectories: 'compiled', 'cache', 'media', 'log'. 
If you use full page caching or partial page caching functionality 'var' directory will 
contain 'pages' subdirectory and 'images' subdirectory in case of using image caching feature.

NOTE: Normally all this directories are created automatically provided 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/var has appropriate permissions.

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-var
	|
	+-compiled
	|
	+-cache
	|
	+-log
	|
	+-media
	|
	+-pages
	|
	+-images

Also if you want to run tests you will have to duplicate 'var' directory in
'YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/tests/' and set the same permissions.

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-tests
	|
	+-var


After installation use /root/admin address to get access to the administration zone.
To log in use 'admin' as a login and 'test' as a password.
