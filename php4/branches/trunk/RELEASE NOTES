Version 2.3.1(candle)

This is primarily a bugfix, mess cleanup and speed optimization release.

As for optimization, we tried to cache tree calls maximally, thus reducing total SQL overhead
(in some cases it may result in about 30% overall perfomance speedup). This lead to total refactoring
of tree subsystem and we hope there are enough tests to make sure everything works fine.

However some more thorough testing is still required since we had to add some dirty hacks into access
policy subsystem due to tree changes(we hope to refactor access policy stuff in 2.4).

See CHANGELOG for more details

Version 2.3(final)

We've decided to release 2.3 final version without new admin GUI since we'd like to stabilize 2.3
branch development. The new admin GUI stuff will go into 2.4(surprize).

This is mostly a bugfix version with some quite important user usability improvements:

1)One of the most frustrating usability issues we had prior this release was quite awkward output of
the form error summary. We had ugly non-localizibale 'title' attribute for every form input which
was used in form error summary report. Now we're using <label> tag for this purpose which is way
cleaner and more flexible. However this techique will work only with js switched on in browser, well
anyway most of the LIMB GUI stuff will work if js is enabled.

2)We splitted a quite bloated common.js into small and highly specialized modules which are plugged in
with include(src) function. This is the first attempt to handle js chaos.

3)richedit tag has beta support for multiple richedit components. Currently is supports htmlArea,
FckEditor, wysisygPro js editors. By default htmlArea is used. Richedit type can be set via 'DEAULT_RICHEDIT'
constant.

4)New "group by referers" functionality added to stat reports. You can setup how to group certain types
of referers using masks. These masks are stored in /core/settings/referers_groups.ini. Here's a short
example of what can be inside this file:

  groups[] = *google.*
  groups[] = *yandex.ru*
  groups[] = *rambler.ru*

Thus all http://www.google.com/..., http://google.ru/... referers will match *google.* group and will
be summarized by this group.

5)Many little yet very annoying bugs were spotted and fixed.

You should exeperience no problem using previous releases of demo and empty projects.

Version 2.3RC3

This is mostly a bugfix version with some improved functionality:

1)First of all we're trying to make LIMB core as small as possible and remove all external
dependencies from it and use them separately. For user convenience we'll be storing all external
packages on which LIMB may depend on as archieves in LIMB_DIR/external directory. The following
packages were put to LIMB_DIR/external:

  * phpMailer(http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/) - the previous mail system was based on PEAR
  classes and we found it unsatisfactory, so we completely removed it in favor of this nice package.
  LIMB uses this package via PHPMailer_DIR constant. This package is optional.

  * XML_HTMLSax(http://pear.php.net/package/XML_HTMLSax) - currently we use it for viewing and
  beautifying template source on-line. LIMB uses this package via XML_HTMLSAX3 constant. This
  package is optional.

  * SimpleTest(http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php) - excellent package for unit testing. LIMB
  uses this package via SIMPLE_TEST constant. This package is required for LIMB tests.

2)Init sql dumps were moved to empty-project since it's more logical to have them there.

3)Improved support for Apache mod_rewrite(this can help run LIMB with PHP installed as a CGI
executable) - check out the INSTALL file in LIMB project root directory.

4)`title` varchar(255) default NULL field was added to sys_metadata db table. Make sure you update
your database if you're upgrading from the previous version of LIMB!!!

5)access_policy class interface was a bit changed, specifically signature of the save_object_access
method: save_object_access($policy_array, $accessor_type, $accessor_ids = array()) instead:
save_object_access($policy_array, $accessor_ids = array(), $accessor_type)

See CHANGELOG for more details

You can also use improved versions of demo and empty projects from 2.3RC3 release (
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=109345&package_id=118079&release_id=299005 )
