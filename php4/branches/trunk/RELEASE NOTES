Version 2.3RC3

This is mostly a bugfix version with some improved functionality:

1)First of all we're trying to make LIMB core as small as possible and remove all external
dependencies from it and use them separately. For user convenience we'll be storing all external
packages on which LIMB may depend on as archieves in LIMB_DIR/external directory. The following
packages were put to LIMB_DIR/external:

  * phpMailer(http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net/) - the previous mail system was based on PEAR
  classes and we found it unsatisfactory, so we completely removed it in favor of this nice package.
  LIMB uses this package via PHPMailer_DIR constant. This package is optional.

  * XML_HTMLSax(http://pear.php.net/package/XML_HTMLSax) - currently we use it for viewing and
  beautifying template source on-line. LIMB uses this package via XML_HTMLSAX3 constant. This
  package is optional.

  * SimpleTest(http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php) - excellent package for unit testing. LIMB
  uses this package via SIMPLE_TEST constant. This package is required for LIMB tests.

2)Init sql dumps were moved to empty-project since it's more logical to have them there.

3)Improved support for Apache mod_rewrite(this can help run LIMB with PHP installed as a CGI
executable) - check out the INSTALL file in LIMB project root directory.

4)`title` varchar(255) default NULL field was added to sys_metadata db table. Make sure you update
your database if you're upgrading from the previous version of LIMB!!!

5)access_policy class interface was a bit changed, specifically signature of the save_object_access
method: save_object_access($policy_array, $accessor_type, $accessor_ids = array()) instead:
save_object_access($policy_array, $accessor_ids = array(), $accessor_type)

See CHANGELOG for more details
