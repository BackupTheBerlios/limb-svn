LIMB contains the following directories in its root directory:

LIMB_DIR 
|
+ - core – here all LIMB classes are stored (except test cases).
|
+ - design – site appearance: images, templates, css-files etc
|
+ - var – PHP compiled templates, media files, log and cache file are stored here
|
+ - tests - Simpletest cases

NOTE: Project file structure should be similar to LIMB. This is required by file name resolving rules.

Now we can examine the directory structure in more detail.

LIMB_DIR/core
|
+ - actions – all classes that implement site
   functionality are stored here. 
   The action classes for site_objects are usually kept in directories named 
   specifically to simplify browsing.
   (e.g. create_article_action, edit_article_action and delete_article_action 
   are good candidates to be stored in the LIMB/core/actions/article directory, 
   this is not mandatory yet it helps to grow familiar with LIMB)
|
+ - controllers – site objects controllers are placed here.
|
+ - datasource – fetching helper classes can be found here. Our templates are active and their activity mostly implemented by datasources.
|
+ - db_tables – db_tables are classes representing specific tables in the data base. These classes have methods for type-casting, fetching/creating/editing/deleting rows. They're also useful for cascade deleting since some db drivers don't support this feature(e.g. MySQL). In the nearest future we are planning to use db tables to create specific db schema automatically.
|
+ - lib – this a LIMB utility classes library
|
+ - locale – ini-files for locale configurations can be found here
|
+ - model – We keep model classes mostly here. However one can find audit, statistics, search, response related stuff(subject to be placed somewhere else). 
|
+ - settings – template mechanism ini-files are kept here (this is a WACT artifact).
|
+ - strings – ini-files with localized strings.
|
+ - template – WACT template mechanism with LIMB specific tags and components
|
+ - tree – Classes to deal with hierarchic structures.
       

Getting deeper: the LIMB_DIR/core/model directory

LIMB_DIR/core/model    
           |
           + - chat – very simple implementation of chat. We had a simple project with chat so these files are simply here.
           |
           + - response – action responses classes(action::perform() is responsible to return some response). 
           |
           + - search - search functionality classes.
           |
           + - shop – A simple yet robust implementation of the shopping cart.
           |
           + - site_objects – site_objects classes.
           |
           + - stats – statistics and user audit related classes are kept here. You can also find here stats and audit report classes.

Now it's time for the LIMB_DIR/core/template directory

LIMB_DIR/core/templates    
 |
 + - compiler - compiler classes
 |
 + - components – runtime components classes
 |
 + - fileschemes – file name resolving classes
 |
 + - tags – tags files 
     |
     + - actions – tags to display JIP-actions
     |
     + - cart – helper tags for shopping cart
     |
     + - chat – chat helper tags 
     |
     + - core – some core WACT original tags and a lot of LIMB specific ones(probably some of these should be moved to somewhere else). 
     |
     + - datasource – datasource tag
     |
     + - dev – tags to view templates sources.
     |
     + - fetch – template's fetching tags. Complement datasource tag
     |
     + - form – tags to work with forms. Includes selectors, buttons, inputs and so on.
     |
     + - grid – tags to output tabular data(sort of WACT list tags)
     |
     + - hint – tags to display small popups with legend.
     |
     + - locale – data localization tags
     |
     + - metadata – meta specific tags
     |
     + - order – deprecated
     |
     + - pager - tag for data paginating 
     |
     + - phpbb – some helper tags to use LIMB with phpbb
     |
     + - poll – poll tags
     |
     + - print – outputs link to print version of object if it supports print_version action,
     |
     + - status – document flow tags 
     |
     + - user – some helper tags to render user specific information.
