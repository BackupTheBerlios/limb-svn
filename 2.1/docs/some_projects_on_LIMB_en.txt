
HOW TO MANTAIN SEVERAL PROJECTS USING SAME LIMB INSTANCE

From the very beginning LIMB has been developed to manage several projects
being a shared instance. We store it separately from 
the projects. It becomes possible with having LIMB_DIR constant pointing at the LIMB directory. 
Our common projects directory structure has the following scheme:

+ - /var/dev/
		|
		+ - LIMB_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_1_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_2_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_3_DIR

Every project requires the following files at its root directory

+-PROJECT_DIR
	|
	+ - setup.php (setup_custom.php is optional)
	|
	+ - root
	|
	+ - index.php (depends on how your web-server was customized, coould be index.html)
	|
	+ - .htaccess (optional)

You also need to create 'var' PHP accessible directory in your project directory:

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-var
	|
	+-compiled
	|
	+-cache
	|
	+-log
	|
	+-media
	
Your web-server must have permissions to read and write files in these
directories.

You can look for more information about projects instalation 
in 'install' file in your LIMB package. Also you may want to look a bit 
about LIMB file structure.

Initial sql-files for database fill could be found in 'init' of 
you LIMB directory. There are initial sql-files for English and Russian 
sites and test database (language independ).

If you manage several projects on one version of LIMB then try to avoid
templates and classes modifications in LIMB_DIR as far it could 
affect more than project.
