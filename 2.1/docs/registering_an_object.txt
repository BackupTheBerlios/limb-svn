REGISTERING NEW SITE OBJECT

To register the absolutely new site object admin_page object's register_new_object action is used. 
It permits you to create site objects in any node of the objects tree. 

To create a new object input its class name, identifier, title and
path to the parent node. If the object is
successfully registered you should see a confirmation message above the form.

When the new object is created you will probably want to check'n'set object's permissions for groups and
you will surely want to check'n'set actions access and actions access templates.
