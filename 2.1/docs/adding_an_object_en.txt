ADDING AN OBJECT AT ANY POINT

To create an absolutely new object we use create_object.php script that
could be found at your project root directory. You use this script if 
there is no appropriate action at any object you have with a project.
So create_object.php permits you to create objects at any node of
site tree. 

NOTE: create_object.php doesn't require authentication
so don't leave it at your public site. The problem will be solved 
to new release. We will put create_object action in one
of LIMB basic site objects (probably admin_page).

To create a new object input its class name, identifier, title and
the path to parent object. You can set parent path as '/' to create
completely new branch in site tree like /root (e.g. /en, /ru). This
is useful then you try to create multilanguage sites. If object was
created you will see a message above the form.

NOTE: create_object.php script doesn't check identifier uniqueness
with in one parent. It's you responsibility for now. We hope to 
fix it soon.

When a new object is created (and it's the first object of class)
you will probably want to set actions permissions and actions access
templates. Also you will probably want to set object's permissions for groups.
To know more about LIMB access policy visit this page http://limb/documents/AccessPolicy.

After settings permissions you can start working with object. Usually 
we create a navigation links like /path_to_object?action=admin_display
for admin pages and /path_to_object for common pages for quick access 
if object acts as a parent object for some functionality such as news or catalog etc.
