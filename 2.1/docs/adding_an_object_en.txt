REGISTERING NEW SITE OBJECT

To register an absolutely new object we use create_object.php script that
can be found at your project root directory. 
create_object.php permits you to create objects at any node of the objects tree. 

NOTE: create_object.php doesn't require authentication, don't leave it at your public site. 
It's a pretty depricated and ugly tool to be replaced with packaging mechanism in the future release.

To create a new object input its class name, identifier, title and
path to the parent node. You can set parent path to '/' to create
completely new branch in site tree like /root (e.g. /en, /ru). This
is useful when you try to create multilanguage sites. If the object was
successfully registered you should see a message above the form.

NOTE: create_object.php script doesn't check identifier uniqueness among the selected node children. 
It's your responsibility for now.

When a new object is created (and it's the first object of class)
you will probably want to set actions permissions and actions access
templates. Also you will probably want to set object's permissions for groups.

After settings permissions you can start working with object. Usually 
we create a navigation links like /path_to_object?action=admin_display
for admin pages and /path_to_object for common pages for quick access 
if object acts as a parent object for some functionality such as news or catalog etc.
