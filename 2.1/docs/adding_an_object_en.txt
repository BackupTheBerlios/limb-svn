REGISTERING NEW SITE OBJECT

To register an absolutely new object we use create_object.php script that
can be found at your project root directory. 
create_object.php permits you to create objects at any node of the objects tree. 

NOTE: create_object.php doesn't require authentication, don't leave it at your public site. 
It's a pretty depricated and ugly tool to be replaced with packaging mechanism in the future release.

To create a new object input its class name, identifier, title and
path to the parent node. You can set parent path to '/' to create
completely new branch in site tree like /root (e.g. /en, /ru). This
is useful when you try to create multilanguage sites. If the object is
successfully registered you should see a message above the form.

NOTE: create_object.php script doesn't check identifier uniqueness among the selected parent children. 
It's your responsibility for now to assign proper identifier.

When a new object is created you will probably want to check'n'set object's permissions for groups and
you will surely want to check'n'set actions access and actions access templates.
