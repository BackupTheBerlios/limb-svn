Version 2.2.1
(27 July 2004, from /trunk)
svn://svn.berlios.de/limb/tags/2.2.1

  --  SimpleTest 6 beta, throws warning if mock is declared more than once, some tests were fixed 
      to conform to this nice behaviour
  --  initial revision of fr.ini locale(just for compatibility)
  --  initial revision of limb_application class, which turns root.php into an object, which also allows to 
      define filters for custom project in a more flexible manner
  --  if visitor enters 0(zero) quantity for the specified cart item, the item is removed from the cart      
  --  RFE SimpleTest 1.0 beta 6 upgrade(issue #982734)
  --  RFE debug memory consumption statistics(issue #978780)
  --  debug html output is written to sys::client_ip() . '-debug.html'
  --  fixed: small bug in debug class (typo 'verbosity_level' instead of 'level');
  --  fixed: resolve_template_compiled_file_name doesn't take into account current CONTENT_LOCALE_ID
  --  pictured_news added to limb
  --  fixed: user object doesn't call parent constructor
  --  fixed: generated password mail template resolving bug
  --  image_select can remember working path during user session(RFE #994493, partially)
  --  datasource tag will look for target in the root of the template if it's not found in the immediate parent
  --  fixed: setup_developer includes debug class and debug includes error.inc.php, that tries to setup error 
      handler via debug, however at this point none of the constants are defined. debug doesn't include 
      error.inc.php now.
  --  fixed: cache_lite a lot of bug fixes
  --  new shipping_locator super type class, which supports caching of shipping options
  --  new shiping_configuration class, it's used to configure shipping_locator, removing long arguments list
  --  new fake_shipping_locator which is for testing only since it doesn't make any real connect job
  --  node_select now remembers its working path during user session (RFE #994493, partially)
  --  initial arabic locale ini file added;
  --  title tag now can accept offset_path attribute;
  --  parent selection is added to several objects forms;
  --  fixed: WACT codewriter::get_temp_variable() returns invalid variable name, when there are many temp variables
      (more than 26?)
  --  a bit improved fedex shipping locator functionality
  --  core:STATUS tag does not require constant to be defined at compile time.
  --  form_edit_site_object_action :: _valid_perform_prepare_data(&$data) added for flexible inheritance purpose
  --  initial version of fedex_shipping_locator fetching FedEx shipping services and prices on-line. Html fetching 
      is done via curl and html parsing is done via XML_HTMLSax.
  --  complex_array :: sort_array($array, $sort_params, $preserve_keys) new $preserve_keys flag, default is true
  --  small javascript checkbox fix
  --  tree class improvements: now tree wouldn't init expanded parents by default, call 
      $tree->initialize_expanded_parents() instead where it's required. And this is required in 2 places 
      now(AFAIK): site structure and objects access. That's it. This method should be explicitly called if you want 
      to see a neat toggable tree. This allows to decrease visitor session size greatly and makes a little speed up!
  --  fixed: tree :: initialize_tree_driver($driver) - omits $driver argument, uses default 
      materialized_path_driver always
  --  fixed: Extra input (issue #991978)
  --  fixed: Error in Fetcher.class (issue #991938)
  --  if user has no rights for the object or action, he is redirected to the login page every time, 
      it seems to be more usable
  --  fixed: <core:htmlspecialchars> uses ENT_QUOTES option now
  --  fixed: invalid_value_rule would throw an error comparing int 0 with any string(wrong type juggling)
  --  fixed: project db tests wouldn't execute at all
  --  project site objects tests are separated from the project db tests, no __project_check_group.class.php, 
      project_db_check_group.class.php and project_site_objects_check_group.class.php instead
  --  objects access actions and templates refactored (memory leak fixed): fetching tree moved from template to 
      action, access policy loads policy arrays only for displayed objects, not for all tree
  --  new invalid_value_rule, which makes sure that the specified value is not valid and validator will trigger 
      an error. This is especially useful for droplists with default meaningless value, like '----', 
      '...choose one' etc
  --  new complex_array::array_map_recursive() static method, which works just like array_map, yet allows to 
      process nested arrays
  --  uri class modified: it makes use of complex_array::array_map_recursive() to urlencode nested query items and 
      complex_array::to_flat_array() to properly render nested query items 
  --  added order type 'rand()' because of MySQL and other databases can perform ORDER BY RAND() operation. 
      (Needs some another refactoring to abstract method RAND() at database layer)
  --  implementation of db_cart_handler which allows to 'remember' cart items for registered users, furthermore it 
      transparantly merges visitor cart items with registered user items, if visitor placed some items to cart and 
      logged in later
  --  setlocale(LC_ALL, 'ru') removed from root.php, now it's locale_definition_filter's responsibility. This 
      explicit call was moved to locale::setlocale() method and the decision which locale identifier should be 
      used is decided upon LC_ALL property value defined in locale ini file.
  --  VERY important modification: all session objects are not required to have __get_class_path() method anymore, 
      instead you have to define in constructor '__session_class_path' attribute with the same value. 
      This is more flexible, since sometimes we can have objects which are not instantiated via 
      instantiate_session_object (i.e cart_items). Now session handler finds in the session BLOB all 
      __session_class_path serialized values and includes the appropriate files.
  --  cart item and user objects changed according to new session objects policy
  --  new initial cart_handlers functionality
  --  added tag POLL_ACTIVE. it can be useful in projects with full_page_cache. renders it's contents whether 
      user can vote or not (in contrast to POLL tag);
  --  poll_container_controller and vote_action corrected
  --  RFE: better formatting of the long debug strings, improved SQL execution control, 
      small debug class refactoring(issue #987460)
  --  materialized_path_driver::get_root_nodes() small cache improvement, root nodes are actually retrieved 
      only once within one transaction, however this is experimental and subject to change!
  --  'created date' and 'modified date' attributes now can be custom defined while creating object
  --  fixed: select multiple functionality finally got repaired and re-implemented
  --  form_edit_site_object_action::_init_dataspace() uses its _load_object_data() instead of 
      fetch_requested_object() thus providing better flexibility for decendants
  --  navigation item changed:
      * added publish, unpublish ations to controller;
      * added new attribute 'new_window' which can be used to determine whether open link in new window or not. 
      ATTENTION: this leads to adding new field 'new_window' in 'navigation_item' table in database;
      * templates corrected
  --  fixed: fs::mkdir(), if such a directory already exists it just returns true now. Especially useful for 
      safe_mode!
  --  if there's no 'popup' attribute in the request, the change user locale action will redirect to 
      $_SERVER['HTTP_RESPONSE'] if it exists and to '/' if not
  --  VAR_URL => VAR_WEB_DIR, from now it'll be a common practice to insert WEB before DIR to indicate a 
      web accessible path to directory(e.g IMAGE_CACHE_WEB_DIR)
  --  RFE: Mozilla tooltips(issue #984895)
  --  image caching has been greatly improved: now it's way more optimized since it analyzes which images were already 
      cached so overhead fectching never happens. It can be effectively used even without full page caching and 
      later it'll be(seems like) pretty easy to delete cache for the specific changed images
  --  fixed: small typo in locale string
  --  send_plain_mail.inc.php now included where it's used
  --  fixed: simple navigation datasource wouldn't properly highlight uris from different hosts if they have 
      similar pathes  
  --  image rotate tests are commented, since this functionality is not available all the the time. 
      For example, imagerotate is available only when php is compiled with bundled gd. In the future the 
       image library should check if this function is available and throw an exception...
  --  swf stuff removed for now...
  --  fixed: nested sets driver returns wrong max child identifier
  --  fixed: max identifier problem(issue #982675)
  --  fixed: template source display action crashed with force_compile flag set to 0
  --  http_response class new methods readfile(), file_sent(), use_client_cache() and minor fixes, ALL 
      http response stuff MUST be made using this class
  --  fixed: display_image_action and display_file_action classes, they use http_response class properly
      (hopefully there will be tests for them soon)
  --  fixed: stats_event_filter - it used non-existent merge method of the request object

Version 2.2
(29 June 2004, from /trunk)
svn://svn.berlios.de/limb/tags/2.2

  --  ***WARNING***: BC break! API of controllers, actions has changed! 
  
  --  fixed: db_module - now column_types array passed into sql_update method
  
  --  initial revision of the interception filters implementation, 
      this led to the vast refactoring of ALL actions. Have a look at root.php :)
  --  new request class resposible for incapsulating of all request specific operations, 
      this one should also help in future testing. You can't just use $_REQUEST['parameter'] variable any longer, 
      use request->get_attribute('parameter') instead
  --  new http_response class responsible for 'deferred' client responses, redirects, headers etc
  --  optimizations of fetcher
  --  got FINALLY rid of old confusing responses classes! The execution status is stored in request instead
  --  new jip_filter implemented. By default the fetcher now assigns actions for the requested object only. 
      jip_filter enables JIP if the user is logged in and he is a member of at least one of groups 
      listed in jip_groups.ini file (stored in settings dir).
  --  fixed: node_links_datasource bug - it caused to undefined array index error if the linked object was not fetched.
  --  minor optimizations based on XDebug output: locale, template tags, etc
  
  --  all validation rules are instantiated via resolve_handle, it touched all form actions in some way
  --  create_object function in objects_support.inc.php was refactored, it uses resolve_handle too, no eval no more!
  --  new refactored version of the uri class
  --  RFE: minor changes flag implemented(issue #958901)
  --  RFE: flexible page caching(issue #970358)
  --  RFE: IMG caching functionality(issue #977471)
  --  new register_testing_ini function for testing purposes allowing to override ini file access inside test case
  --  WACT output cache renamed, <core:OUTPUTCACHE> => <core:LITECACHE>, <core:OUTPUTCACHE> is used for the page partial
      caching
  --  ini class is heavily tested and refactored
  --  fetch_one_by_id() global function added to 'shortcut' fetcher :: fetch_one_by_id()
  --  added new datatype 'float' to db_module. It includes some dirty hacking - international float format 
      transformations, e.g. using comma instead of dot separator
  --  /core/lib/locale renamed to /core/lib/i18n
  --  new <control_button> tag
  --  refactored common.js: from now it will be a common practice to pass DOM element itself not its id 
      since there maybe several DOM elements with the same id on the page
      (which is likely not valid, yet it's not that easy to avoid :( )
  --  dir class was renamed to fs(file system) class since it's a more appropriate name
  --  new dataspace_registry: instance method was removed from dataspace, it makes dataspace much cleaner and 
      will help us to use WACT implementation transparently
  --  cron manager and cron jobs new implementation
  --  fetcher :: flush_cache() is called in form_edit_site_object action and set_publish_status action.
  --  response => http_response, response is just an abstract class now, 
  --  new nonbuffered_response class added
  --  <form> tag MUST have 'name' attribute now
  --  search_fetcher :: fetch() now can analyze $params['restricted_classes'] && $params['allowed_classes'] and 
      transfer their ids to full_text_search :: find() method, which returns object ids only with needed class_ids. 
      This is useful when you want to execute full text search on site excluding several object types from result 
      or including in result only several needed object types.
      search_fetcher :: search_fetch_sub_branch() can't perform such restriction in easy way for now because 
      it works directly with tree.  

Version 2.1.1
(16 Jun 2004, from /trunk)
svn://svn.berlios.de/limb/tags/2.1.1

  --  ***WARNING***: BC break! API of controllers, actions has changed! 
  --  controllers, actions are greatly refactored in order to simplify inheritance(packages preparation)
  --  RFE: unified delete site object action (issue #959366)
  --  new SiteObjectsTestManager allowing to run specific site object testers
  --  russian language pack added to phpbb forum
  --  node select component doesn't try to get mapped node id if value is not set, it's a 
      form_create_site_object's resposibility to set it ptoperly, thus we decrease coupling, i guess...
  --  create_link_action doesn't set non-existent node id now, there's simply no need for that(see above)  
  --  RFE: initial revision of site objects linking functionality(#970235 issue)
  --  RFE: it's possible to select parent node with node select component (part of the #971013 issue)
  --  new tree_node_id_rule
  --  added tree_node_id_rule into form_create_site_object_action and form_edit_site_object_action  
  --  request_state component now takes its value from the $_REQUEST on the first display only

Version 2.1
(04 May 2004, from /2.0.8)
svn://svn.berlios.de/limb/tags/2.1

  --  fixed: node select component would set its value wrong
  --  fixed: control_flow.php bug (issue #969501)
  --  fixed: value localization in form components moved at runtime(issue #968107)
  --  fixed: JS window.onunload function for richedit
  --  fixed: pager sporadically wouldn't show paginated links (issue #964194)
  --  fixed: <hint> tag is Mozilla, Opera compatible (issue #964192)
  --  fixed: full_text_search can perform fulltext search with mysqlversion >= 3.23. 
      and it returns empty result instead of raising error.
  --  fixed: all JS document.all[...] calls replaced with document.getElementById
  --  fixed: materialized_path_driver for tree bug fixed. 
      Now, if there are 2 or more sub_trees in objects tree, 
      get_sub_branch() method with 'check_expanded_parents' option works properly 
      (result set included nodes from another sub_tree before)
  --  fixed: 'has_more_than_one_page' typo in pager tags, components
  --  fixed: mod_rewrite compatibility
  --  fixed: error uses debug :: parse_console();
  --  fixed: small typo in /image/edit_variations.html (issue #955789)
  --  fixed: fetch_tree_datasource now do hierarchical sort items correctly
  --  fixed: critical JS error: add_form_hidden_parameter function behaved bad...
      it added hidden input with id 'action' and this input overrided form.action
  --  fixed: if there was a try to log in directly from /root/login page, 
      login action would redirect you to /root/login again, 
      now this situation is checked and the user is redirected to /      
  --  fixed: render_attributes() function in input_form_element, 
      earlier it would set value attribute empty if there's no value in dataspace. 
      This behaviour(adopted from WACT) would delete 'value' value from template
  --  fixed: probable error recursion bug

  --  function load_project_tages added to template_compiler.inc.php to allow 
      working of project specific files
  --  metadata component refactored to implement inheritance for project specific metadata
  --  attribute 'url' added to each object at site map to allow proper displaying 
      of not only navigation_item objects
  --  for speed issues with images and files all dont track responses replaced with mere exit()
  --  RFE: new <grid:COUNTER> tag (issue #964271)
  --  RFE: got rid of create_object.php now it's a regular action of the admin_page object(issue #958092)
  --  new tree_path_rule rule
  --  got rid of PHP_SELF, REQUEST_URI constants, taken directly from $_SERVER!
  --  project specific setup_custom.php is included in project setup.php in a smart way 
      via dirname(__FILE__), this provides much better flexibility
  --  all tests except image tests run on Linux
  --  got rid of netpbm binary files, these should be stored as external ones
  --  new <status:PUBLISHED> tag
  --  new dont_track_response allows not to register object access in stats system, 
      this is especially effective for image and file objects
  --  changed display_image_action so that it returns dont_track_response if variation is 
      not 'original'
  --  changed display_file_action so that it returns dont_track_response if it 
      displays a file icon  
  --  new version.php describing current version of LIMB in detail
      (will hopefully help in package building automating tasks)
  --  fetch_sub_branch_datasource_component verifies datasource to be a subclass of 
      fetch_sub_branch_datasource
  --  CLI indexer.php script added for rebuilding full text index
  --  new <metadata:CHARSET> tag, it displays charset according to current MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID   
  --  'status' field in sys_site_object db table is considered to be a bit mask now
  --  new multi items functionality: delete, publish, unpublish, set_priority
  --  SimpleTest moved to /tests/lib
  --  test files renamed: *.group.php => *_group.class.php, * .test.php => *_test.class.php
  --  added 'children' field in sys_site_object_tree table, it breaks normalization a bit, 
      however it allows us to know for sure how many immidiate children certain parent has

svn://svn.berlios.de/limb/tags/2.0.8

  --  fixed: image_object::_create_variations() method was called twice
  --  fixed: richedit, now can properly save values of multiple richedits on one page
  --  fixed: tree bug, now include_parent while get_sub_dbranch() works properly
  --  fixed: major bug in dir class - mkdir, rmdir, cp methods were buggy
  --  fixed: major bug in cron.php - it just crashed totally  

  --  new tree: uses tree drivers, materialized path and nested sets currently implemented
  --  basic multilanguage support:
      * available locales are declared in global $AVAILABLE_LOCALES
        (e.g, $AVAILABLE_LOCALES = array('ru', 'en'); 
      * MAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID definition depends on user::_locale_id property, 
        if no such property(or empty), CONTENT_LOCALE_ID used
      * new action in login object: change_user_locale, 
        allows to change current management locale
      * user::get_locale_id, user::set_locale_id

  --  pager_navigator tag now supports "mirror_of" attribute. If "mirror_of" 
      attribute is set, mirrored pager runtime component is used instead of 
      creating a new runtime component
  --  new <core:REQUEST_TRANSFER attribute='name'> tag which allows to append
      values from $_REQUEST to specific html tags attributes: a, form, frame, input, area.

      are comma separated

      ERROR_DOCUMENT_404, ERROR_DOCUMENT_403 in setup.php, also
      added not_found object to display 404 error message
