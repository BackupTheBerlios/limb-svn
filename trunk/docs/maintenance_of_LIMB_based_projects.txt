
HOW TO MANTAIN SEVERAL PROJECTS USING SAME LIMB INSTANCE

From the very beginning LIMB has been developed to manage several projects
being a shared instance. 
We store it separately from the LIMB based projects. 
It becomes possible with having LIMB_DIR constant pointing at the LIMB directory. 
Our development projects directory has the following structure:

+ - /var/dev/
		|
		+ - LIMB_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_1_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_2_DIR
		|
		+ - PROJECT_3_DIR

Every project requires the following files at its root directory

+-PROJECT_DIR
	|
	+ - setup.php
	|
	+ - setup_custom.php (this one is optional yet convenient for setup.php overriding)
	|
	+ - root (the only one LIMB entry point, sort of Front Controller)
	|
	+ - index.php (usually just redirects to root)
	|
	+ - .htaccess (optional)

You also need to create 'var' PHP accessible directory in your project directory.
All temporary, non .svn stuff goes here.
NOTE: The directory structure of var is usually autogenerated, that's why appropriate permissions in *nix is required.
In general it has the following structure:

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-var
	|
	+-compiled(WACT compiled templates)
	|
	+-cache(internal LIMB cache, *.ini files etc)
	|
	+-log(you can find notice.log, warning.log, error.log files here, very useful for error tracking)
	|
	+-media(all LIMB media: LIMB doesn't use db BLOBs for media, data is stored in the file structure)
	
You can find more info on installing LIMB issues in the LIMB_DIR/INSTALL file.
