LOCALE CLASSES

To deal with different locales and strings LIMB use the following
classes locale and strings with could be found at LIMB_DIR/core/lib/locale/ 
directory.
* locale class used for date, currency and numeric data formatting.
ini-files for different locale settings are stored in 
LIMB_DIR/core/locale directory.
* strings class used for localized strings resolving. ini-files with
localized strings could be found at:
	1) PROJECT_DIR/core/strings
	2) LIMB_DIR/core/strings
We have translated strings on English (as far as possible) 
and Russian only. The common usage of strings class is:
	echo strings :: get($string_name, $file_name, $language_id);

Real file name equals to $file_name + '_' + language_id.
strings first looks for necessary file in the project strings directory 
and if file is not found - in the limb strings directory. If no file
found an error rised. In case only string not found - only warning raised.
strings ini-files could be inherit from other file using something like
that in it:

[extends]

filename = some_other_file

LOCALE CONSTANTS

LIMB uses 2 constants to deal with localization:
1) CONTENT_LOCALE_ID - current object's locale.
2) MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID - current user's locale. It is used for 
localise mamagement messages, validation errors, action names etc.

Each LIMB site object has it's LOCALE_ID (e.g 'en' or 'ru'). It stored 
in sys_site_object table (see URL db_organization_chart). 
Every new object inherits parent's LOCALE_ID by default.
Unfortunately we don't have user interface for setting object's LOCALE_ID
for the moment. Any way it possible to create multilanguage site with
LIMB easy.

CONTENT_LOCALE_ID is defined with object's LOCALE_ID then object is fetched in root.

MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID constant is stored in user session data. If 
MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID is not defined (in case it's a new visitor or 
user just executed logout action), then MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID defined
as CONTENT_LOCALE_ID. Thus general uses see messages in the same 
language as object 
User can change his MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID during logging into a site.
It is also possible to change MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID using a form
like right-upper corner form on http:://limbdemo.0x00.ru demo site. To 
change his MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID user must have access to 
change_user_locale action in login object.

The list of available locales is defined by global variable in setup.php
in project root directory. It looks something like that:

$AVAILABLE_LOCALES = array('ru', ‘en’); 


Let's see how and where these locale constants are used.

* MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID - default value for language_id in 
	get methid of strings class.

* CONTENT_LOCALE_ID - default value for locale :: instance();

* Tag <locale:STRING name=’string_name’ file=’strings_file_name’ locale_type=’{management|content}’> 
MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID is used by default

* Tag <locale:DATE_FORMAT hash_id=’var_name’ format=’format_type’ type=’{stamp|string}’ locale_type=’{management|content}’>
  CONTENT_LOCALE_ID is used by default
 
* Tag < locale:LOCALE name=’locale_name’ locale_type=’{management|content}’>
CONTENT_LOCALE_ID - default value

* Any control tag (e.g. INPUT, BUTTON etc.) can use locale_type, 
	locale_value, locale_file to set control value. Default locale_type
	is management.

* Every page charset is defined by MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID. 
	See metadata:CHARSET tag.

* All form validation errors renders using MANAGEMENT_LOCALE_ID.

Default values have chosen based on usage frequency. We didn't have
any special plan or feature request for localizing. So you see
the result of slow evolution. We would be only glad if you have 
any ideas or requests in this field.

We have a couple of experiences of creating muiltilanguage sites using
LIMB. You read the details here.
