Objects version control

Any LIMB content object supports versioning. When the user
changes the content object (like article, document), the object's version number
is increased and the full object copy is saved in db. 
Currently 'minor changes' option is not implemented in case there's no need to create a new version. 
Update method of the content object receives a boolean flag whether it's required to 
create the new version or not(content_object :: update((bool) $new_version)).

At the moment the default version behaviour can be overriden by creating a form_edit_site_object_action
de's descendant and replacing its _update_object_operation() method:

class your_action extends form_edit_site_object_action
{
	[...]
	function _update_object_operation()
	{
		if(!$this->object->update(false))
			return false;
		else
			return true;
	}
}

To browse the list of versions of an object and to be able to examine
the object's state for any version you need to add an extra action 
to content object controller:

class document_controller extends site_object_controller
{
	function document_controller()
	{
		$this->_actions = array(
				[...]
				'admin_detail' => array(
						'permissions_required' => 'r',
						'template_path' => '/admin/object_detail_info.html',
						'popup' => true,
						'JIP' => true,
						'img_src' => '/shared/images/admin_detail.gif',
						'action_name' => strings :: get('detail_info'),
				),
		);

		parent :: site_object_controller();
	}
}

NOTE: object_detail_info.html template renders content object system 
information and the versions list.

To be able to recover version or to see all content object's attributes
for any version you need to have the access to the /root/version site object(to the display and recover actions in particular). 

Recover action – creates a new version of the content object based on the version you provide, e.g. if you recover version
5 and the current version is 7, then the 5-th version is copied to the new 8 version.

NOTE: The LIMB versioning is at the very initial stage. 
It provides a simple yet effective solution for the domain of simple objects.
Any complexity requires manual handling!
