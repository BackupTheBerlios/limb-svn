 !!!WARNING!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the pre-alfa of the first public release of the LIMB  based  project. These
instructions contain ***only*** necessary information on how to get LIMB based project
working.
You're strongly required to be able to configure Apache, MySQL.
If you're stuck and need help, please feel free to contact the developers at 
the LIMB CMF support site http://limb-project.com or directly over email limb@0x00.ru 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OS : OS independent

Web Server: Apache  1.3+ (configured  with  AllowOverride  All for directory where 
you plan to place your project) with php installed as a module(important!)

Development Environment: PHP 4.2+  

Preferred Database: MySQL 3.23+ (4.0+ more prefered)
(LIMB will work on 3.23+ with InnoDB support.LIMB uses full text search 
capabilities of 3.23+ version)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	PROJECT SETUP  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Unpack the downloaded LIMB archive
1.	Unpack the downloaded empty project archive
2.	Edit the project settings in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/setup_custom.php
3.	Load database dump with structure and initial data from init_en.sql or init_ru.sql,
    you can find them in LIMB_DIR/init/ directory
4.  For more information on registering new objects or templates customization
    please visit http://limb-project.com/root/documentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  APACHE SETUP 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use your web server to host only 1 website you need to set your DocumentRoot option 
to point to your project's root directory, i.e.
DocumentRoot YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY

You also have either to copy contents from YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ to 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/shared/ or make an alias to that directory, i.e.
Alias /shared YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/

If you host many website on your web server you can make changes to Virtual Hosts section 
of httpd.conf file. Here's a valid example of the virtual host setup:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.6

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.6>
    DocumentRoot YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    ServerName YOUR_PROJECT
    ErrorLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-error_log
    CustomLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-access_log common
		Alias /shared YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/
</VirtualHost>

Please note that you need to write an alias for shared directory in the apache 
project virtual host section. You may skip this step by simply copying 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ contents to YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/shared/ directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SETTING PERMISSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your PHP installation will need write access to the YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/var directory.
Usually this directory contains several subdirectories: 'compiled', 'cache', 'media', 'log'
(they're created automatically provided YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/var has appropriate permissions). 

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-var
	|
	+-compiled
	|
	+-cache
	|
	+-log
	|
	+-media
	
Also if you want to run tests you will have to duplicate 'var' directory in
'YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/tests/' and set the same permissions(currently tests are not included).

YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
+-tests
	|
	+-var


After installation use /root/admin address to get access to the administration zone.
To log in use 'admin' as a login and 'test' as a password.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  config.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every project has config.ini file in /core/settings directory.

By default it contains only one valuable parameter:
force_compile = 1

This parameter forces the WACT template engine to recompile the template every time 
it is requested, this is useful for development. For speed purposes on production environments 
you will definitely want it to be set to 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TEMPLATE FILE NAME RESOLVING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Templates can be found in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/design/main/templates/
directory or in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/design/default/templates/ directory.

Template engine first looks up the requested template in
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/design/main/templates/ 
if not found, it tries
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/design/default/templates/.
