--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 !!!WARNING!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the pre-alfa of the first public release of the LIMB  based  project. These
instructions contain ***only*** necessary information on how to get LIMB based project
working.
You're strongly required to be able to configure Apache, MySQL.
If you're stuck and need help, please feel free to contact the developers over email: 
limb@0x00.ru

***This package doesn't contains tests yet, they will be included later***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OS : OS independent

Web Server: Apache  1.3+ (configured  with  AllowOverride  All) with php istalled as
a module(important!)

Development Environment: PHP 4.2+  

Preferred Database: MySQL 4.0+ 
(LIMB will work on 3.23+ with InnoDB support, however LIMB uses full text search 
capabilities of 4.0+ version, hence no search support below 4.0)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	SETUP PROJECT 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Unpack downloaded archive
2.	Edit project settings in setup_custom.php
3.	Dump data base structure and initial data from sql.sql that you can find 
		in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/init/ directory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	SETUP APACHE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a small example of the virtual host setup:

NameVirtualHost 192.168.0.6

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.6>
    DocumentRoot YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    ServerName YOUR_PROJECT
    ErrorLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-error_log
    CustomLog logs/YOUR_PROJECT-access_log common
		Alias /shared YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/
</VirtualHost>

Please note that you need to write an alias for shared directory in the apache 
project virtual host section. You may skip this step by simply copying 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/shared/ contents to YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/shared/ directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	SETTING PERMISSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your PHP installation will need write access to a 'var' directory in the project directory.
Usually this directory contains several subdirectorys: 'compiled', 'cache', 'media', 'log'. 

var
|
+-compiled
|
+-cache
|
+-log
|
+-media
	
Also if you want to run tests you will have to duplicate 'var' directory in
'YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/tests/' (currently tests are not included).

After installation use /root/admin address to get access to the administration zone.
To log in use 'admin' as a login and 'test' as a password.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	config.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every project has config.ini file in /core/settings directory.

By default it contains only one valuable parameter:
force_compile = 1

This parameter forces the WACT template engine to recompile template every time 
it is requested, this is useful for development, however for production and speed 
purposes you will definitely want it to be set to 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TEMPLATE FILE NAME RESOLVING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Templates can be found in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/design/main/templates/
directory or in YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/design/default/templates/ directory.

Templating engine first looks up the requested template in
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/design/main/templates/ 
if not found, it tries
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/limb/design/default/templates/.
